                             The clean Command

   Usage

   clean [options] <Root-class> ...

   Command clean removes all intermediate files produced by previous
   compile or compile_to_c.
   Names (<Root-class> ...) can have the Eiffel suffix, no suffix at all,
   or the suffix used for SmartEiffel command files on your system (.make
   on UNIX or .BAT on DOS for example).

   Options

   -help:
          Display a brief summary of the command-line syntax and a
          complete list of finder options.
   -verbose:
          Print system information during the compilation (full path of
          loaded files, type inference score, removed files, etc.).
   -version:
          Show the number of the version of SmartEiffel you're using.

   Examples

   Example 1
   To remove intermediate files produced for the HELLO_WORLD program.

   Type:                  clean hello_world
   You can also type:     clean hello_world.e
   or you can also type:  clean HELLO_WORLD
   on Unix, you can type: clean hello_world.make
   on DOS, you can do:    clean hello_world.BAT

   Example 2
   Under Unix or DOS, remove all intermediates files in the current
   directory : clean *.e
   If the root class file is not in the current directory, you can type
   (for Unix) : clean *.make

   Option -verbose can be used to see which files are removed.
