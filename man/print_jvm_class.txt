                        The print_jvm_class Command

   Usage

   print_jvm_class [options] <Path>[.class]

   Command print_jvm_class prints a human readable version of the <Path>
   class file. Printing is done on standard output. This command was
   developed to check the byte code produced by command compile_to_jvm.
   It is useful only if you want to have a close look at the generated
   Java byte code.

   This command may also be used to print Java byte code you obtained
   with Java compilers, such as javac. We find the output of
   print_jvm_class more readable than the output of javap.

   Options

   -help:
          Display a brief summary of the command-line syntax and a
          complete list of print_jvm_class options.
   -verbose:
          Print additional informations.
   -version:
          Show the number of the version of SmartEiffel you're using.

   Examples

   First, you have to produce some class files using command
   compile_to_jvm:
          compile_to_jvm -boost hello_world

   Then, using command print_to_jvm_class you can print on standard
   output a readable view of any produced class file. The following
   command prints the main class:
          print_jvm_class hello_world.class

   You can also print any class file of the hello_world directory. For
   example, under Unix, you can print the byte code produced for class
   INTEGER using command:
          print_jvm_class hello_world/integer.class
