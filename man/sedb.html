<p>
The SmartEiffel debugger is an <i>embedded debugger</i>. It means that to use
it, you must compile your application with the special command option
<tt>-sedb</tt>. The generated executable is then equipped with the debugger,
you just have to start it as you would without it.
</p>

<p>
The debugger offers many powerful commands, that let you look into the guts of
your program:
</p>

<ul>
<li>commands that control <a href="#execution">the execution</a>,</li>
<li>commands that set or reset <a href="#breakpoints">breakpoints</a>,</li>
<li>commands that allow to <a href="#data-display">display data</a>,</li>
<li>and some <a href="#other">other commands<a>.</li>
</ul>

<table border="0" cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#3366FF">
<tr>
<td><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+2">
<a name="generated-type-ids">Execution commands</a></font></td>
</tr>
</table>

Those commands are meant to make your program advance; either walk step by
step, or by greater strides, or run until its end.

Whatever command you choose, the program will run at most to the next
breakpoint (<a href="#breakpoints">see below</a>) or till you press
<tt>^C</tt>.

The available commands are:

<blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">s</td>
<td>
Make a single step; if it involves entering into another routine (it's a
feature call), then so be it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">n</td>
<td>
Make a single step, without entering into any other routine (it means that a
feature call is seen as a single step).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">f</td>
<td>
Stride to the end of the current routine.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">c</td>
<td>
Run till the next breakpoint, or till the end.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<table border="0" cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#3366FF">
<tr>
<td><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+2">
<a name="generated-type-ids">Breakpoints</a></font></td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that the breakpoints in the code (marked by the pseudo-instruction
<tt>sedb_breakpoint</tt>) are heeded; they work as manually-added breakpoints.

Here are the commands to manage manually-added breakpoints:

<blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">b</td>
<td>
Add a breakpoint. There are many possibilities, among which you can choose a
subset to define. All the criteria you choose must be met for the breakpoint
to be activated.
<p>
The possible criteria are described below.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">B</td>
<td>
Display all the manually-added breakpoints.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">-&nbsp;<i>&lt;num&gt;</i></td>
<td>
Removes the breakpoint designed by its number (you can see that number by the
'B' command).
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>


<p>
When setting a breakpoint, the possible criteria are:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Name indication</b>: The name information of the debugging stack contains
information about the name of the routine called as well as the base class
where this routine is defined. The name indication of the breakpoint can be
any substring to be searched within the name information of the stack. For
example, if the name indication is "item", the execution would stop in feature
<tt>item</tt> of <tt>STRING</tt> but also in feature <tt>item</tt> of
<tt>ARRAY</tt>, in feature <tt>item</tt> of <tt>DICTIONARY</tt>, etc.  If the
name indication is "item STRING", execution would stop only in routine
<tt>item</tt> defined in class </tt>STRING. Also note that the name indication
can be any substring. For example, if the name indication is "is_", the
execution would stop in <tt>is_empty</tt>, <tt>is_integer</tt>,
<tt>is_real</tt>, etc. As another example, if the name indication is "STRI",
the execution would stop at any place in classes <tt>STRING</tt>,
<tt>ARRAY[STRING]</tt>, <tt>DICTIONARY[STRING,FOO]</tt>, etc.  Finally, also
note that the "invariant" string is used when the execution is in the <i>class
invariant</i> of some class, hence allowing you to spot all class invariant
execution.
</li>
<li>
<b>File indication</b>: If you want to stop each time the execution reaches
the <tt>string.e</tt> file class, it can be achieved easily by setting the
file indication to "string.e".  Because the file name indication is applied on
the whole path of the file, the file indication allows you to filter more than
a simple file name. For example, if the file indication is "lib/kernel", the
execution would stop each time execution reaches some code in the
<tt>kernel</tt> cluster of the SmartEiffel library.
</li>
<li>
<b>Line range</b>: The line range information allows you to select the line
range to be considered.  For example, to stop each time execution reaches line
12 or 13 in some file, just enter [12,13] as a line range.
</li>
<li>
<b>Stack limit</b>: The stack limit condition allows you to watch the stack
size during execution. (This is useful to debug bad recursive calls.) For
example, a stack limit of 10 would stop the execution as soon as the stack
size reaches this 10 limit. The automatic incrementation option causes the
stack-limit to be incremented each time the corresponding breakpoint
matches. A breakpoint composed only of a single stack limit condition is a
perfect watch dog of stack memory consumption.
</li>
</ul>

Here is how <tt>sedb_breakpoint</tt> works:
<p>
The feature <tt>sedb_breakpoint</tt> defined in class <tt>GENERAL</tt> can be
used to set a breakpoint directly in your Eiffel source file. Keep in mind
that you must recompile your system each time some Eiffel source file is
modified. Thus each time you add a <tt>sedb_breakpoint</tt> call to some
Eiffel source file you must recompile your code first. Also note that a
<tt>sedb_breakpoint</tt> is always enabled even when the corresponding source
file is not traced (see ACE file mode).

<tr>
<td><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+2">
<a name="generated-type-ids">Data display</a></font></td>

<p>
The following commands allow you to look at the data of your program:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table width="100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">e&nbsp;<i>&lt;exp&gt;</i></td>
<td>
Evaluates and displays the result of an expression. <b>Note that</b> currently
only object attributes can be displayed (general Eiffel expression are not
supported).
<p>
What you can do is:
<ul>
<li>display either Current or any local variable or parameter of the current
routine;</li>
<li>display any attribute of the above objects, using the standard Eiffel
dotted expression (e.g. <tt>e&nbsp;my_string.count</tt>);</li>
<li>display any element of a <tt>NATIVE_ARRAY</tt>, using a special notation:
a dot followed by the offset of the object you want to display
(e.g. <tt>e&nbsp;my_string.storage.4</tt>);</li>
<li>recursively string dotted expressions (like in the above example, or even
more complex expressions).</li>
</ul>
<i>Note:</i> the 'e' command is available since SmartEiffel&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;beta&nbsp;3.
</td>
</tr>

Display the current frame.

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">u</td>
<td>

"current frame" (you can display Current and so on of <i>that</i> frame).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="center" width="5%">d</td>
<td>
Down in the stack (go back to the callee). Note that the 'e' expressions follow the
"current frame" (you can display Current and so on of <i>that</i> frame).
