Installation instructions
=========================

* From source, UNIX

This assumes you have downloaded a release, which is a file called

  SmartEiffel-1.2r1.tar.gz

Where instead of r1 you may have a higher version number (r2, r3, r4, ...).
in the commands below, substitute r1 for the number of your file.

This package should be unpacked in the place where you want SmartEiffel 1.2
to be installed. A usual place is /usr/lib, or somewhere inside your home
directory if you want to install as an unprivileged user. Enter the following
commands.

  cd /usr/lib # You can change this for your location of choice
  tar xzf your/downlaod/path/SmartEiffel-1.2r1.tar.gz
  cd SmartEiffel12
  ./configure
  make

after this, you should have SmartEiffel 12 installed.

If you prefer a custom installation, run "make interactive" instead of just
"make". You can customize the location of the config file, the OS
autodetection, paths, compiler options and modes, etc. The defaults should
be fine for almost anything.
