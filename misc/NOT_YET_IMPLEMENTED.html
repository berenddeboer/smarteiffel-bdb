When you <B>repeatedly inherit</B> from a class that contains a routine that assigns
to an attribute, and specify for the routine and attribute to be replicated
twice, the routine fails to follow the replicated feature. That is, you
have two routines assigning to the one attribute, instead of having two
routines assigning to different attributes. This contravenes the discussion
in ETL p. 174-177. The following code illustrates the issue (it fails at
run-time).</LI>

<PRE>class BOARD
feature
   set_max_board_members (b: INTEGER) is
      do
         max := b;
      end
   max: INTEGER
end</PRE>

<PRE>class BOARD2
inherit
   BOARD
      rename
         set_max_board_members as set_min_board_members,
         max as min
      end
   BOARD
      select set_max_board_members
   end
end</PRE>

<PRE>class BOARD_ORGANISER
creation make
feature
   make is
      do
         !!board2;
         board2.set_max_board_members (3)
         board2.set_min_board_members (1)
         check
            board2.max = 3
         end
      end;
   board2: BOARD2;
end</PRE>
This bug is not easy to fix at all and also seems to be present in all
commercial Eiffel compilers (if your commercial compiler can correctly
execute this code, please drop us a note to advise us otherwise).

Some features of <B>class BIT</B> are not yet implemented when using long BIT
sequences (i.e. more than 32 bits). All unimplemented features are reported
at compile-time (please do not report these, except where you cannot work
around them).

<B>Command line arguments</B> cannot be given as argument of the root procedure
(not yet implemented).
For the time being, you can use features <TT>argument_count</TT> and
<TT>argument</TT> of class GENERAL.
