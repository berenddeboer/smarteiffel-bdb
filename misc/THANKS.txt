                          SmartEiffel Contributors

   *** Frank ARNAUD: bug report of test_tag1.e. Reported a problem with
   Windows NT / Microsoft C / empty struct. Reported a bug about
   renaming/redefinition of Eiffel externals. New maintainer of the
   Eiffel FAQ.
   *** Eric BEZAULT: lots of really good (short!) bug reports:
   rename/select, statically computed expressions, weird uses of
   inheritance clause, insisted to give SmartEiffel a -case_insensitive
   flag...
   *** Xavier CREGUT: has been using SmartEiffel for a long time. Many
   bug reports. Reported in a very small program a tricky bug dealing
   with inheritance/genericity and VNCG rule.
   *** Geoff ELDRIDGE: since many years, Geoff is one of the best
   SmartEiffel's supporter thanks to the excellent elj-win32
   distribution. Keep up the good work Geoff ! As a side-note, Geoff is
   also the initial designer of the BASIC_TIME class.
   *** Enrico GOBBETTI: many (excellent) bug reports and many good
   bug-fixes .
   *** James GRAVES: initial design of exception handling, on which we
   based our final implementation. Maintainer of SmartEiffel's RPMs for
   RedHat Linux.
   *** Alain LE GUENNEC: many well-isolated bug reports plus some very
   good bug-fixes.
   *** S.u.S.E. GNU/Linux: since mid-1998, the S.u.S.E. GNU/Linux
   distribution is our main development OS. Indeed, we have already
   received for free all versions from 4.3 to 7.3. Also note that
   SmartEiffel The GNU Eiffel Compiler is part of the S.u.S.E. GNU/Linux
   distribution. We are grateful to S.u.S.E for being very supportive to
   us. We hope the S.u.S.E. GNU/Linux team will keep up the good work,
   being successful and providing us with free copies of their
   distribution ;-)
                    ___________________________________

   ** Reimer BEHRENDS: isolated a bug about once pre-computed functions
   and many other bugs.
   ** Nigel BREE: fixed a tricky bug in the runtime stack. Improved
   portability for Windows95/NT. Wrote the install script for
   Windows95/NT.
   ** Thierry DE CARVALHO: found a bug in inspect/when. Fixed a bug in
   STD_FILE_READ.connect_to.
   ** Emmanuel CECCHET: updates of the Linux executable. Found some bugs
   in creation calls. Provided a lot of useful comments.
   ** Valery CROIZIER: reported bugs (in very numerous mails :-).
   Provided hints to optimise the C code.
   ** Andre DOHERTY: used to maintain the SmartEiffel ready for OS2
   version.
   ** Antoine GUARRIGUES: worked with Philippe RIBET.
   ** Wai-Ming HO: many well-isolated bug reports, plus one tricky
   Garbage Collector bug with fix.
   ** Jean-Marc JÉZÉQUEL: reported some bugs on ARRAY inheritance.
   Isolated a bug on VNCG. Beta testing.
   ** Alexander KJELDAAS: fixed a bug in INSTALL.CSH. Reported a problem
   with mixed rename/redefine and a problem with run time stack.
   ** Philippe LAHIRE: reported some bugs with repeated inheritance.
   Isolated some problems with select.
   ** Antony LE LABOUSSE: worked with Cyril ADRIAN.
   ** Greg Lee: many good bug reports and many patches and needed
   updates, mostly related to Java byte-code generation.
   ** Jean-Lin PACHERIE: many bug reports.
   ** Marc SCALZOLARO: reported some bugs and added some tests for
   expanded class types.
   ** Fridtjof SIEBERT: for some well isolated bug reports.
   ** Glen STONE: improved the type inference score as well as code
   generation (more dispatch functions are now removed). Also sent some
   good bug reports.
   ** Brian STRELIOFF: reported some bugs. Gave me some good hints about
   compatibility with C++ and warning messages of gcc.
   ** Jerome THOEN: author of some (optimised) features to avoid memory
   leaks.
   ** Dan WILDER: uploads new versions of SmartEiffel to sunsite (for
   Linux).
   ** Richard WALKER: promotes the use of SmartEiffel at the Australian
   National University and helps us to improve SmartEiffel's
   documentation.
   ** Alan ZIMMERMAN: clear bug report with an excellent fix for the
   exception trace. For one aspect, the problem was specific to the
   CYGWIN compiler and its implementation of longjmp. The second bug was
   related to the unwinding of exception trace immediately before a
   polymorphic call.
