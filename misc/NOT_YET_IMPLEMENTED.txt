   List of known bugs and unimplemented features

     * When  you  repeatedly inherit from a class that contains a routine
       that  assigns  to  an  attribute,  and specify for the routine and
       attribute  to be replicated twice, the routine fails to follow the
       replicated  feature.  That  is, you have two routines assigning to
       the  one  attribute,  instead  of having two routines assigning to
       different  attributes.  This  contravenes the discussion in ETL p.
       174-177.  The  following  code  illustrates the issue (it fails at
       run-time).
class BOARD
feature
   set_max_board_members (b: INTEGER) is
      do
         max := b;
      end
   max: INTEGER
end
class BOARD2
inherit
   BOARD
      rename
         set_max_board_members as set_min_board_members,
         max as min
      end
   BOARD
      select set_max_board_members
   end
end
class BOARD_ORGANISER
creation make
feature
   make is
      do
         !!board2;
         board2.set_max_board_members (3)
         board2.set_min_board_members (1)
         check
            board2.max = 3
         end
      end;
   board2: BOARD2;
end
       This bug is not easy to fix at all and also seems to be present in
       all  commercial  Eiffel compilers (if your commercial compiler can
       correctly  execute  this  code, please drop us a note to advise us
       otherwise).
     * Some features of class BIT are not yet implemented when using long
       BIT sequences (i.e. more than 32 bits). All unimplemented features
       are  reported  at compile-time (please do not report these, except
       where you cannot work around them).
     * Command  line  arguments  cannot  be given as argument of the root
       procedure  (not  yet implemented). For the time being, you can use
       features argument_count and argument of class GENERAL.
     * Features  deep_clone  and  deep_equal of class GENERAL are not yet
       implemented for compile_to_jvm.
     * compile_to_jvm is broken.
     * compile_to_jvm doesn't allow you to make applets.
     * inline agents is not implemented yet.
     * dispose is not implemented yet for expanded objects.
