   The SmartEiffel Team

   The  SmartEiffel  Team  is an informal group of people in the [1]LORIA
   lab   of  Nancy,  France,  gathered  around  the  development  of  new
   compilation   techniques   for  object-oriented  languages  and  their
   implementation in SmartEiffel, The GNU Eiffel compiler.

   [o]
       [2]Dominique COLNET
              Professor at the University of Nancy 2 (I.U.T. Charlemagne).
              Leader of the SmartEiffel project.

       Dominique COLNET is the one who initiated the SmartEiffel project in
       Summer 1994. His goal was to create an inexpensive, bug-free advanced
       Eiffel compiler, unlike those already available on the market.
       He has been the head of this project as well as its key designer and
       implementor since then. (See the [3]history page for more information
       on the chronology of the SmartEiffel project).
   [o]
       Suzanne COLLIN
              Assistant Professor at the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy.

       Suzanne COLLIN has been working on SmartEiffel from the very
       beginning, taking a major part in conceptual and design discussions
       and decisions.
       She also provided the invaluable point of view of a user of
       object-oriented languages working in the field of image processing and
       augmented reality.
       She also gave Dominique three beautiful children :)

       [4]Olivier ZENDRA
              Researcher at INRIA-Lorraine / LORIA. Got his PhD "Translation
              and global optimisation in class languages" working on the
              SmartEiffel project.

       He started working during most of his spare time with Dominique on
       SmallEiffel in late 1994 - early 1995. He had many important
       conceptual and technical discussions with Dominique about languages,
       typing, ANSI C, Java byte-code, garbage collection, etc. and worked on
       the first bootstrap. He also tries to maintain the SmartEiffel Web
       site. He joined the ECOO research team in late 1997 to work almost
       full-time for his PhD on SmallEiffel, which he got with highest
       honours in late 2000.
   [o]
       Philippe RIBET
              Developer on the SmartEiffel project.

       He started working on SmallEiffel before the first public release and
       never stop to use and debug the compiler (mainly the library). He made
       the first port on non-UNIX system: MS-DOS. He joined the SmallEiffel
       team in summer 2001, working full-time on the project. The main aim is
       to develop the graphic library. He worked on other aspects like SCOOP
       for example.
   [o]
       [5]Cyril ADRIAN
              Developer on the SmartEiffel project.

       Like Philippe, he started working on SmallEiffel before it was brought
       to the public. Having learnt Eiffel at school, he never stopped using
       SmallEiffel and now SmartEiffel. He joined the SmartEiffel team in
       summer 2002, working on the project in his free time. He developed a
       new installer, added the [6]Acyclic Visitor design pattern, and worked
       on the first implementation of SCOOP.

   Former but Still Active Team Members

   [o]
       Philippe COUCAUD
              Master Thesis about garbage collection in OO languages.
              Currently working in industry.

       After being a student of Dominique, and in charge of the
       Macintosh-ready versions of SmallEiffel during his free-time since
       1996, Philippe joined the SmallEiffel team of the ECOO research team
       between February and September 1998 for his Master thesis. He worked
       more especially on the garbage collector.

   Other Contributors

   Many people have contributed to SmartEiffel, The GNU Eiffel Compiler.

   The  first  of  them, in chronological order, are the computer science
   students  of  the  University  Henri  Poincaré  of Nancy, France. They
   tested  and  bench-marked it, providing very useful information in the
   early days of SmartEiffel.

   Then,  many people, either working in computer engineering or computer
   science,  or  simply  users  working  in various academic and business
   fields,  took  part  in the process of improving SmartEiffel. Since it
   became  The  GNU  Eiffel Compiler, in early 1998, even more people are
   helping its development.

   We want to thank all these people who help us in this great adventure.
   Although  it  is  not  possible  to  mention them all, here is a short
   [7]list of the most important contributors.
