<P>
The SmartEiffel Team is an informal group of people in the 
<A HREF="http://www.loria.fr">LORIA</A> lab of Nancy, France, 
gathered around the development of new compilation techniques 
for object-oriented languages and their implementation in 
SmartEiffel, The GNU Eiffel compiler.

<DD>
Professor at the University of Nancy 2 (I.U.T. Charlemagne). Leader of the SmartEiffel project.
</DL>
<P>
Dominique COLNET is the one who initiated the SmartEiffel project 
in Summer 1994. His goal was to create an inexpensive, bug-free 
advanced Eiffel compiler, unlike those already available on the market.<BR>
He has been the head of this project as well as its key designer and 
implementor since then. 
(See the <A HREF="HISTORY.html">history page</A> for more information 
on the chronology of the SmartEiffel project).<BR><BR>

<P>
Suzanne COLLIN has been working on SmartEiffel from the very beginning, 
taking a major part in conceptual and design discussions and decisions. <BR>
She also provided the invaluable point of view of a user of
object-oriented languages working in
the field of image processing and augmented reality. <BR>
She also gave
Dominique three beautiful children :)<BR><BR>

<DD>
Researcher at INRIA-Lorraine / LORIA.
Got his PhD "Translation and global optimisation in class languages"
working on the SmartEiffel project. 
</DL>
<P>
He started working during most of his spare time with Dominique 
on SmallEiffel in late 1994 - early 1995. He had many important
conceptual  and technical discussions with Dominique about languages, 
typing, ANSI C, Java byte-code, garbage collection, etc. and worked on
the first bootstrap. He also tries to maintain the SmartEiffel Web
site. 
He joined the ECOO research team in late 1997 to work almost full-time
for his PhD on SmallEiffel, which he got with highest honours in late
2000.

<B>Philippe RIBET</B>
<DD>
Developer on the SmartEiffel project. 
</DL>
<P>
He started working on SmallEiffel before the first public release and never
stop to use and debug the compiler (mainly the library).
He made the first port on non-UNIX system: MS-DOS.
He joined the SmallEiffel team in summer 2001, working full-time on the
project. The main aim is to develop the graphic library. He worked on
other aspects like SCOOP for example.

<DD>
Developer on the SmartEiffel project.
</DL>
<P>
Like Philippe, he started working on SmallEiffel before it was brought to the
public. Having learnt Eiffel at school, he never stopped using SmallEiffel and
now SmartEiffel.  He joined the SmartEiffel team in summer 2002, working on
the project in his free time. He developed a new installer, added the <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcyclicVisitor">Acyclic Visitor</a> design
pattern, and worked on the first implementation of SCOOP.

Currently working in industry.

<P>
After being a student of Dominique, and in charge of the Macintosh-ready 
versions of SmallEiffel during his free-time since 1996, Philippe joined the 
SmallEiffel team of the ECOO research team between February and September 1998 
for his  Master thesis. He worked more especially on the garbage collector.

<P>
Many people have contributed to SmartEiffel, The GNU Eiffel 
Compiler. </P>
<P>
The first of them, in chronological order, are the computer science
students of the University Henri Poincaré of Nancy, France. They tested and 
bench-marked it, providing very useful information in the early days of 
SmartEiffel.</P>
<P>
Then, many people, either working in computer engineering or computer science, or
simply users working in various academic and business fields, took part in the
process of improving SmartEiffel. Since it became The GNU Eiffel Compiler, in 
early 1998, even more people are helping its development.
</P>
<P>
We want to thank all these people who help us in this great adventure.
Although it is not possible to mention them all, here is a 
short <A HREF="THANKS.html">list of the most important contributors</A>.
</P>
