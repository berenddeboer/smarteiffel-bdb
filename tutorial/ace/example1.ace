-- An ACE file can avoid using command arguments to compile some system.
-- ACE means Assembly of Classes in Eiffel.
--
-- To launch the compilation with this ACE file, just type:
-- 
--               compile example1.ace
--
-- This is a very simple example with very small ACE file:
--
system 
    hello -- is the name for the executable

root
    HELLO_WORLD: "make"
    -- To indicate that the execution will start in procedure "make" of 
    -- class HELLO_WORLD.

cluster
	-- In this simple example, a cluster is a simple directory path. 
        -- The compiler will only search Eiffel source code in the following
        -- clusters. The order is important, because the first one is the good 
        -- one. Also note that one may only use the / character as the
	-- directory separator:
	"${SmartEiffelDirectory}tutorial";
	"${SmartEiffelDirectory}lib/kernel";
	"${SmartEiffelDirectory}lib/io"; 

end
